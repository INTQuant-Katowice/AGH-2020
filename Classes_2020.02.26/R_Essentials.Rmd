# Workshop goal

The aim of this study group is to help you get started learning some of the basic tools which will allow you to do data transformation in *R*.

# What will you learn?

We will briefly discuss the essential data structures in base *R*. Then, we are going to focus on the *dplyr* package.

One important point to mention, we will emphasize on **small data**! If you wish to know the basic tools for working with **big data** in *R*, we recommend you to discover the [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) package, for instance.

# Requisites

We need to load and attach some add-on packages to the user's workspace.

* Note:

    The *R* base package is already loaded and attached to the global environment, by default!

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rmarkdown) # Optional R object!
```

# Data structures

The first section of this introductory *R* course is based on the book [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), which is authored by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). We encourage anyone interested in *computer science* to explore this insightful referenced material.

## Vectors

The vector is the basic data structure in *R*. A vector has three common properties: **type** (*what is it?*), **length** (*how many elements does it contain?*), and **attributes** (*metadata*). There are two types of vectors in *R*:

* Atomic vectors.
* Lists.

### Atomic vectors

Atomic vectors are *homogeneous* vectors, i.e. all the elements of an atomic vector must have the same type.

We observe four common types of atomic vectors: **character**, **double** *(which is also known as **numeric**)*, **integer**, and **logical**. Additionally, we observe two rare types of atomic vectors: **complex**, and **raw**.

#### Examples

```{r}
charter <- c("I love R!"); typeof(charter); length(charter)
do_nu <- c(exp(1), pi) ; typeof(do_nu); length(do_nu)
inter <- c(-2L, -1L, 0L, 1L, 2L); typeof(inter); length(inter)
logia <- c(FALSE, TRUE, F, T); typeof(logia); length(logia)
```

### Lists

Lists are *heterogeneous* vectors, i.e. the elements of a list could have different types. For instance:

```{r}
extra_students_info <- list(
  Name = c("Adrian", "Asia", "Hugo", "Magdalena"),
  Age = c(21, 23, 25, 22, 50),
  `Do you love R?` = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
  Year = c(0L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 1L)
)
typeof(extra_students_info)
length(extra_students_info)
```

## Attributes

### What is metadata?

[Metadata](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/metadata) is a set of data which describes and gives information about a set of data.

In summary, the following three items are the most important attributes in *R*:

* Names.

```{r}
names(charter); names(charter) <- c("Emotion")
names(do_nu); names(do_nu) <- c("Euler", "Pi")
names(inter); names(inter) <- c("Minus Two", "Minus One", "Zero", "One", "Two")
names(logia); names(logia) <- c("False!", "True!", "False!", "True!")
names(extra_students_info)
```

* Dimensions.

```{r}
?dim
help("dim")
```

* Class.

```{r}
?class
help("class")
```

## Matrices and arrays

Now, we will consider the multi-dimensional atomic vectors.

```{r}
mix <- matrix(1:32, nrow = 8, ncol = 4)
a_ray <- array(1:32, dim = c(4, 2, 4))
```

## Data frames

A data frame is basically a list which is composed of fixed-length atomic vectors.

```{r}
students_info <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  Name = c("Adrian", "Asia", "Hugo", "Magdalena"),
  Age = c(21, 23, 25, 22),
  `Do you love R?` = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
  Year = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 1L),
  City = c("Katowice", "Cracovia", "Warszawa", "Zakopane")
)
print(students_info)
rownames(students_info)
colnames(students_info) # names(students_info)
nrow(students_info)
ncol(students_info) # length(students_info)
dim(students_info)
```

# Data transformation

The last section of this introductory *R* course is based on the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is authored by [Garrett Grolemund](https://github.com/garrettgman) and [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). We encourage anyone interested in *data science* to explore this insightful referenced material.

* Requisites

    We will use the database included in the *nycflights13* package.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
View(flights)
```

## The `dplyr` package

We will defy our data transformation challenges in *R* using five key `dplyr` functions: `filter()`, `arrange()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()` (*which is also called `summarize()`*). All of these items can be used together with `group_by()`, which is another key `dplyr` function.

The previuosly mentioned key `dplyr` functions form the set of *"verbs for a language of data manipulation"*, in words of [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/).

All verbs work as follows:

* The first function argument is a data frame.
* The successive function arguments describe the way in which we will manipulate the input data frame by using the input data frame variable names.
* The output data frame is the result of the input data frame manipulation/transformation.
